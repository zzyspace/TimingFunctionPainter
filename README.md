# TimingFunctionPainter
---
A tool for painting timing function curves.

### Why?
---
When I'm going to create a more interesting `CAMediaTimingFunction` for `CAAnimation`, I can't imagine the function curve that are generated from control points in method `functionWithControlPoints::::`.

This tool will show you the function curve with given control points. It also can drag the control point to make the function curve what you want.
